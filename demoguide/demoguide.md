### 1. Resources Being Deployed

This solution deploys a complete set of Azure services to support an intelligent, voice-enabled food ordering experience, securely hosted within a defined network boundary.

- **Conversational AI & Order Management**  
  Utilizes Azure OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo, integrated with the Semantic Kernel Planner, to deliver intelligent, natural conversations and automate order processing workflows.

- **NoSQL Data Storage**  
  Azure Cosmos DB provides a highly scalable, low-latency database for storing and retrieving order data and customer interactions.

- **Real-Time Voice Interaction**  
  Azure AI Speech Service (Speech Synthesis) enables the app to communicate with users via natural-sounding voice responses during the ordering process.

- **Network Security Perimeter (NSP)**  
  A logical boundary is established to isolate and secure all deployed services from unauthorized access, following best practices for perimeter-based security.

### 2. What can I demo from this scenario after deployment

After deploying the solution, you can demonstrate the following interactive features:

- Start the application by running `dotnet run`, and initiate the conversation with a greeting, such as:  
  `"Hello!"`

- Ask about the available food options, for example:  
  `"What's on the menu right now?"`

- Continue the dialogue naturally, placing an order through the conversational interface.

- For full visibility during the demo, be sure to show the **Cosmos DB `views` container** in a split-screen view, so observers can see real-time data updates as the interaction progresses.
